# About this collection:
This is a collection of a few of my projects written in C++ from my programming classes at the University of Kentucky

# Disclaimer:
# Some of the code you will see was written by my former proffessor. The files where I was not a sole author include: Project 1
# and Project 3. Project 2 is entirely my code.

# Notice: 
# Under the Project 1 and 3 directories, you will see that there is a makefile. These two projects were developed in a linux 
# environment. Therefore, I can not guarantee that they will work on windows. Project 2 can be compiled successfully in a windows 
# environment provided the user either inserts the files into a solution or existing project.
